                created image.
    Options: tag - Provides a context name for the pull
                   for example - cs-mgmt-base-image or cs-mgmt-sources
             chroot - Path to the chroot environment to query

        __Csversion__ - A dictionary where source versions are stored under
                        'sources'.  'sources' is version info keyed off of
                        the source repo name and a makefile designated tag.
                        The same repo/tag combination will be overwritten
