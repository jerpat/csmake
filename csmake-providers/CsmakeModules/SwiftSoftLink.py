class SwiftSoftLink(CsmakeModule):
    """Library: csmake-providers
       Purpose: Create a soft link for an artefact in swift.
                This can be used as a no-op to set up a
                soft link into a wrapper using SwiftArtefactToWrapper
                or a similar aspect.
       Phase:
           prep - ensures the push container exists
           push - Will push soft links based on the provided options
       Options:
           account - SwiftAccount section id to use to authorize the transfer
                     (because this manages container lifecycle,
                      an admin account must be used - if this is unacceptable,
                      then the "prep" phase can be avoided, and containers may
                      be managed with the swift client, or a different
                      section may be used to create the container)
           container - Container to link artefact(s) from
           to-container - (OPTIONAL) Container to link artefacts to
                              If this is unspecified anr/or noop is set to True
                              then this will set up parameters for an aspect
                              such as SwiftArtefactToWrapper
           files - (OPTIONAL) list of files (either newline or comma delimited)
                   to id from the container.  Posix file wildcards like '*'
                   and '?' can be used.
                   Default is to identify all of the files (i.e., '*').
           latest-only - (OPTIONAL) if True, then only the latest match is
                                    pulled from each file listed.
                         Default is False
           noop - (OPTIONAL) if True, then this will only set up parameters
                             as a SwiftPushArtefact would for an aspect like
                             SwiftArtefactToWrapper
