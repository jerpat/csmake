       Purpose: Set deletion strategy and enforce it.
       Phase:
           push, enforce_policy - Will execute the delete policy
       Options:
           account - SwiftAccount section id to use to authorize the transfer
                     (because this manages container lifecycle,
                      an admin account must be used)
           containers - Container to enforce delete policy
                     Posix file wildcards like '*' and '?' can be used.
           expires - Specify the amount of time before
                        the artefact(s) given in the list should expire
                        after the object's x-timestamp time.
           leave - (OPTIONAL) Leaves the latest # specified
                              Regardless of time.
           objects - (OPTIONAL) The objects to check/delete
                     (either newline or comma delimited) from the container.  
                     Posix file wildcards like '*' and '?' can be used.
                     Default is '*'"""
