class SwiftCopyArtefact(CsmakeModule):
    """Library: csmake-providers
       Purpose: Copy artefacts from a swift container to another.
       Phase:
           prep - ensures the push container exists
           push - Will push the file(s) provided to the container
       Options:
           account - SwiftAccount section id to use to authorize the transfer
                     (because this manages container lifecycle,
                      an admin account must be used - if this is unacceptable,
                      then the "prep" phase can be avoided, and containers may
                      be managed with the swift client, or a different
                      section may be used to create the container)
           container - Container to copy the artefact(s) to
           from-container - Container to copy the artefact(s) from
           objects - (OPTIONAL) The objects to copy (either newline or comma
                     delimited) from the container.  Posix file wildcards like
                     '*' and '?' can be used.
                     Default is to specify ('*')
           latest-only - (OPTIONAL) if True, then only the latest match is
                                    pulled from each object listed.
           access - (OPTIONAL) SwiftAccount section ids that should be given
                     read access to the objects and container
           expires - (OPTIONAL) Specify the amount of time before
                                the artefact will expire
                                                      w = weeks

                                s = seconds
                        Space delimited
                        example: 2w 5d 1h 33s
                          2 weeks, 5 days, 1 hour and 33 seconds to expire"""
