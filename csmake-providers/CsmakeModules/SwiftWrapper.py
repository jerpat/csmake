       Purpose: Creates and provides information for a container that holds
                an entire release set
       Options:
           account - SwiftAccount reference - must be authorized to create containers
           container - Name of the container to use for the wrapper
           access - (OPTIONAL) SwiftAccounts that will be authorized as readers
       Phase: prep - set up wrapper
              getinfo - used by a wrapper aspect to obtain wrapper info
              * - any other phase will just return information about wrapper
       Returns: container name
       Environment: Upon succesful execution of the wrapper section
                    for every phase except getinfo,
                    the wrapper will insert '__wrapper__<id>'
                    into the csmake environment.  This environment definition
                    must exist in order for a wrapper to be later referred to
                    and populated - this allows for the definition of a
                    wrappering process that is ignored if no such wrapper
                    is actually established."""
