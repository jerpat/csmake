    """Purpose: Pull an artefact from a swift container
       Type: Module   Library: csmake-providers
       Phase:
           sources, pull - Will pull the file(s) provided to the container
                  based on the mapping
       Options:
           account - SwiftAccount section id to use to authorize the transfer
                     (because this manages container lifecycle,
                      an admin account must be used - if this is unacceptable,
                      then the "prep" phase can be avoided, and containers may
                      be managed with the swift client, or a different
                      section may be used to create the container)
           container - Container to pull artefact(s) from
           files - (OPTIONAL) list of files (either newline or comma delimited)
                   to pull from the container.  Posix file wildcards like '*'
                   and '?' can be used.
                   Default is to pull all of the files (i.e., '*').
           latest-only - (OPTIONAL) if True, then only the latest match is
                                    pulled from each file listed.
                         Default is False
           result-dir - (OPTIONAL) The result directory to place the files
                         Default is csmake's target
           ignore-fail - (OPTIONAL) if True, failures will be ignored
                         Default is False
           progress - (OPTIONAL) When "False" will suppress progress reports
                         Default is True
