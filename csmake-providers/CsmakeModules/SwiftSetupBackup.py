       Purpose: Create a backup container for a Swift container
       Phase:
           prep - ensures the backup container exists and the container
                  to be backed up (or versioned) has the appropriate
                  metadata.  Backups will be performed automatically
                  when a file is replaced.
       Options:
           account - SwiftAccount section id to use to authorize the transfer
                     (because this manages container lifecycle,
                      an admin account must be used - if this is unacceptable,
                      then the "prep" phase can be avoided, and containers may
                      be managed with the swift client, or a different
                      section may be used to create the container)
           backup - Name of the backup container to create
           container - Name of the container to backup
           access - (OPTIONAL) SwiftAccount section ids that should be given
                     read access to the objects and container"""
