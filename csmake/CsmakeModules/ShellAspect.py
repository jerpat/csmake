    """Purpose: Execute out to a shell command
                on advice of aspect joinpoints
       Type: Aspect   Library: csmake (core)
       Options:
           command(<point>)
              - shell command to execute (semi-colons need to be escaped)
                where <point> is either
                    command(<joinpoint>) or
                    command(<joinpoint>__<phase>)
                    (just as any other aspect)
           advise(<point>[#<time>]) = <advise point>:<vote>
              - Will vote Yes or No on the given advice control point
                (only on commands implemented)
                <time> (optional) represents what it will do on the
                       specified time the
                       the joinpoint specified is executed for the given step
                       If not used the same advice will be given every time
                <advise point> is the flow control point to advise on
                    (e.g., tryAgain)
                <vote> is either True or False
           env - (Optional) Reference to a ShellEnv to use
                 Can be multiple envs, comma or newline separated
                 Default is the csmake execution environment
           exec - (Optional) Shell command to use
                 Default is /bin/bash
       Phase: Any
       Joinpoint: Any
           Defaults are:
               avoided - given when a section will be avoided ~~future~~
               start - given when a section will be started
               passed - given when a section completes successfully
               failed - given when a section fails
               exception - given when a section causes an exception
               end - given when a section completes execution
           Flow control issues for advise are:
               doNotStart - checked after 'start'
               tryAgain - checked after passed, failed, and exception
               doNotAvoid - checked after 'avoided' ~~future~~
       Example:
           [ShellEnv@my-command-env]
           THIS_DIR=mydir

           [Command@my-step]
           stuff=happens
