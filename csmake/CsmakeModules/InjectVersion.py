       Type: Module   Library: csmake (core)
       Phases:
           build, package - Will do the replacement in a build or package step
           clean - Delete the versioned file only if it's not in-place
       Mapping: Expects a 1-1 mapping - may be in-place
                WARNING: Original source files should not be in-place
                         This module will modify files on the right side
                         of the mapping.
       Options:
           match - String to match and replace in files with the current version
                   Take care not to make this something that is easily matched
                   NOTE: csmake '%' environment substitutions
                         will not be performed
           version-marker - (OPTIONAL) String to use to separate the
