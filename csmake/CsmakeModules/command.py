class command(CsmakeModuleAllPhase):
    """Purpose: Execute a series of build steps - the initial step is
                a command provided by the command line input (see --command)
       Type: Module    Library: csmake (core)
       Phases: *any*
       Options: The keys are used to order the steps lexicographically
              e.g.: 1, 10, 2, 20, 200, 3, A, a (suggestion use 0000-9999)
              The values are atomic groups of steps
                 , - denotes step follows the next
                 & - denotes steps that can be run in parallel
           description - Provides a description of the command that
                         csmake will use for --list-commands.
       Example:
           [command@build-pond]
           description = "This will build a small pond"
           10 = init
           20 = repo1 & repo2 & repo3, repo4
           30 = createPond
           40 = stockFish

           Execution of the "build-pond" command would proceed as follows:
           The init section would execute
           Then repo1, repo2, and repo3 would execute in parallel
           Then repo4 would execute
           Then createPond would execute
           Finally, stockFish would execute
