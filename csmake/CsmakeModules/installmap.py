class installmap(CsmakeModuleAllPhase):
    """Purpose: Generically describe a set of files and their intended
                installation points for a Packager installer target.
       Type: Module   Library: csmake (core)
       Description:
                The module will parse the various section options and return
                a list of dictionaries with the following keys (as defined in
                Options, below):
                   maps - dictionary of file mappings into the installation
                          target
                   key - <key>
                   type - <source-type>
                   intent - <source-intent> (None if unspecified)
                   destination - <destination>
                   copyright - [ parsed copyright dictionaries ]
                      (If not defined, will inherit the copyrights defined
                       in the metadata.  If that's not defined, will
                       be None)
                   files - list of dict containing:
                       owner - (<owner>, uid)
                       group - (<group>, gid)
                       mod - "chmod" style octal code
                       file - <file or directory to install>
       Phases:
           *any*
       Options:
           map_<mapkey> -
               map: a file mapping (as in **maps)
                    **NOTE: Be sure to escape any right curly braces '}'
                            That are not marking mapped path names,
                            e.g., {~~file~~}
               [copyright: <copyright-id>]
                   should refer to a copyright specification in the makefile
                   if not included, the metadata's copyright will be used.
               owner: a user on the installed system
               group: a group on the installed system
               permissions: permissions to provide for the installed file

           path_<pathkey> - <ID>
               The pathkey represents a semantic mapping that
               packaging modules would define.
               The ID is used in the maps enclosed in curly braces
               to denote a necessary substitution.

               For example:
                   path_root=INSTALL_ROOT
                   map_mymap=map: <bin> -(1-1)-> {INSTALL_ROOT}/bin/{~~file~~}

               A Packager would key off of the "root" part to define its
               understanding of what 'root' means.  INSTALL_ROOT would
               mark where that 'root' path goes in the mappings.

               The purpose for having this 'path_root=<ID>' notation is
               to allow the 'installmap' section the ability to unify different
               Packager's paths into a common delivery definition.  For example,
               say we have a WindowsMSIPackage and a DebianPackage that
               we want to create a common 'installmap' section for.
               For the sake of the example, let's assume DebianPackage has
               a "root" path, and WindowsMSIPackage has a "ProgramFiles" path
               and we want to unify these concepts into a single ID,
               INSTALLATION_POINT.  We would define the following options in
               the installmap section:
                   path_root=INSTALLATION_POINT
                   path_ProgramFiles=INSTALLATION_POINT

               By doing this, we have avoided the need for two separate
               installmaps, even though the concepts of "root" and
               "ProgramFiles" are vastly different.

           owner_<userkey> - <ID>
           group_<groupkey> - <ID>
               These options allow the installmap to unify differing user
               definitions as a single user.  For example, a linux-oriented
               packager may have a concept of a "root" user and root user
               permissions, but a windows-oriented packager may have a
               concept of an "Administrator" user and Administrator permissions
               Allowing an installmap, for this example, to define:
                  user_root=ROOT
                  user_Administrator=ROOT
               Allows the installmap to unify these permissions into a single
               installmap definition.
