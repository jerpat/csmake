       Type: Module   Library: csmake (core)
       Phases: *any*
       Options: Adds all flags into the environment for future steps
       Example:
           [ShellEnv@my-command-env]
           THIS_IS_AWESOME = this is/a really/coolpath

           would be available in the scripts defined in that Shell section,
           as in the [Shell@do-awesome] section above.
