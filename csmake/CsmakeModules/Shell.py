class Shell(CsmakeModuleAllPhase):
    """Purpose: Execute a shell script
       Type: Module   Library: csmake (core)
       Options:
         :: Script Definition Options ::
           command(<phase>) - Shell command to execute in specified phase
                 If (<phase>) is not specified: 'build' is assumed
           command-clean(<phase>) - Like 'command', but file tracking
                           will assume cleaning is occurring
                           Thus files for file delcarations
                           and mappings will be checked for removal.
                 If (<phase>) is not specified: 'clean' is assumed
           command-no-verify(<phase>) - Like command, except file tracking
                           will not verify the files for tracking.
           NOTE: If multiple commands are specified for a single phase
                 the first one found is used.
           ALSO NOTE: <phase> may specify multiple phases comma (,) delimited

         :: Execution Options ::
           env - (OPTIONAL) Reference to one or more ShellEnv
                            section(s) to evaluate.
                            (May be any section that yields a dictionary
                             with keys that are valid shell identifiers)
                    Default: Uses the csmake execution environment
                    (comma and/or newline delimited)
           exec - (OPTIONAL) Will execute given command as the shell
                    Default: /bin/bash

         :: Parsing Options ::
           line-pad - (OPTIONAL) character to use to pad every line to preserve
                                 leading spaces.  Useful if using python as
                                 the 'exec', for example.
       Phase: Any
       File Tracking:
           A shell variable is defined named _MAPPING that represents the
           definition of **maps in the shell environment.
           _MAPPING may be iterested in the shell, e.g.:
               for map in $_MAPPING
           The structure of each map is:
                <from1>,,<from2>,,...;;<to1>,,<to2>,,...
           If exec is a bash shell patched with the shellshock fixes,
           the environment will also contain two accessor functions
                _froms and _tos
           The functions should be used in a subshell like:
                $(_froms $map)
           Which would yield:
                <from1> <from2> ...
           NOTE: because of the use of ';;' and ',,' as delimiters, the mapping
                 functions cannot handle files containing ',,' and ';;'.
           ALSO NOTE: The shellshock patch requires exported functions to
                      be surrounded with BASH_FUNC_<name>%% to be valid
                      in the bash environment..._froms and _tos are both defined
                      in this manner.
       Examples:
           [ShellEnv@my-command-env]
           THIS_DIR=mydir

           [Shell@my-command]
           command = mkdir -p ${THIS_DIR} && pushd ${THIS_DIR}
              ifconfig > my.cfg
              ls
              popd
              ls
           env = my-command-env, default-env

           The following will iterate through a group of
           files defined in the my-files group and move each one to
           essentially a new path and a new extension
           in the test and build phases:

           [Shell@my-mapped-command]
           **maps=<my-files> -(1-1)-> %(APATH)s/{~~filename~~}.newer
           command(test, build) = for x in $_MAPPING
              do
                  for from in $(_froms $x)
                  do
                      for to in $(_tos $x)
                      do
                          mv $from $to
                      done
                  done
              done

           This example will create a tarball containing the given files in
           the mapping in the 'build' phase and cleans the zip up in the 'clean'
           phase:
           [ShellWithMapping@my-archive]
           **maps=<the-files> -(*-1)-> %(LOCATION)s/my-archive.zip
           command = for x in $_MAPPING
               do
                   tar -czf $(_tos $x) $(_froms $x)
               done
           clean-command = for x in $_MAPPING
               do
                   rm -rf $(_tos $x)
               done
           NOTE: This wouldn't cover all cases, say where a second file was
                 introduced in the "to" side of the mapping and the mapping
                 was changed to a -(*-*)-> or possibly if a second clause
                 is added using the '&&' conjunction for **maps
