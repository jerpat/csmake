from Csmake.CsmakeModuleAllPhase import CsmakeModuleAllPhase

class environment(CsmakeModuleAllPhase):
    """Purpose: Adds specified option(key)/value pairs into the environment
       Type: Module   Library: csmake (core)
       Phases: *any*
       Options: Adds all options into the environment for future steps
       Example:
           [environment@default]
           mypath = /another/abs/%(dpath)sPath/yeah
           dpath  = this is/a really/coolpath

           mypath would evaluate to:
                 /another/abs/this is/a really/coolpathPath/yeah
           and both "mypath" and "dpath" would be entered into the csmake
           environment.
       Usage:
           csmake environment variables may be accessed using the python
           dictionary "mod" operator notation, %(<variable>)s
           So, with the example above, a later step could access 'mypath'
           by using %(mypath)s in one of its options.
