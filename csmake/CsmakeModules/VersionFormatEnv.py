class VersionFormatEnv(CsmakeModuleAllPhase):
    """Purpose: Generate version strings into the csmake environment
       Type: Module   Library: csmake (core)
       Phases: Any
       Options:
           format - The format of the version string to generate
                    into the environment.  Use version designations
                    in curly braces to bring in parts of the version
                    together.
                    NOTE: 'primary' is the version designation defined in
                                    the metadata
                          'primary-major' is the version designation of just
                                    the major version number
                          'primary-minor' is the version designation of just
                                    the minor version number
                          'primary-patch' is the version designation of just
                                    the patch revision number
           env-name - Environment variable name that will hold the version
                      string specified by 'format'
       Example:
           [VersionFormatEnv@my-version]
           format = {primary-patch}+{build-number}
           env-name = FULL_BUILD_NUMBER

           Assuming that a 'versioning' section (or something else) has
           defined a version designation of 'build-number' (for this example
           let's assume it's defined ad 151512) and the 'metadata' section
           has defined a version of say 5.2.4141.  This section would produce
           a csmake environment variable 'FULL_BUILD_NUMBER' set to the value
           4141+151512.
